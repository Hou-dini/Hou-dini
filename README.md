# Hi there, I'm Eli! 👋

### Applied AI Engineer | Agent Architect | Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) Specialist

I transform complex manual workflows into autonomous multi-agent systems. With a background in **Software Engineering** and **Quantitative Analysis**, I bridge the gap between high-level reasoning and robust, production-ready AI orchestration.

### 🚀 The Mission: Engineering Reliable Autonomy

I don’t just build "AI wrappers." I architect **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems** that reason, plan, and execute. My core focus is solving the **fragility** of traditional LLM implementations by applying modular task decomposition, RAG-grounded execution, and adversarial risk-checking.

**My Architectural Philosophy:**

* **Decoupled Reasoning:** Utilizing the **Nexus-Specialist** pattern to mitigate LLM hallucinations.
* **Grounded Execution:** Ensuring every agentic decision is backed by verifiable, real-time data ingestion.
* **Adversarial Rigor:** Implementing "Red-Team" agents to stress-test system logic before deployment.

### 🏆 Portfolio Highlight: Kognia AI

**Kognia AI** is a hierarchical MAS framework for autonomous research synthesis and strategic evaluation. It serves as the core proof-of-concept for my Nexus-Specialist architecture.

#### 🧐🔎🤖 System Observability: Kognia AI

Below is a comprehensive log trace of the orchestration process. This "white-box" view provides key insights into the agentic lifecycle: agent handovers, tool invocations, and internal reasoning chains, facilitating deep debugging and system auditability.

### 🌱 Current Focus: The "Virtual Trading Desk"

I am currently engineering a **Local Trade Reasoning Engine** as a flagship demonstration of financial agentic frameworks.

* **Orchestration:** Engineering complex delegation loops with **CrewAI**.
* **Memory & RAG:** Leveraging **Weaviate** for hybrid search and long-term agentic memory.
* **Local Inference:** Optimizing **Qwen3-30B-MoE** models for high-performance local reasoning.
* **Adversarial Logic:** Developing a **Risk Simulation Agent** to veto setups based on market regime shifts.
* **Observability:** Implementing deep-trace logging to audit agentic "thought processes" in real-time.

### 🛠️ The Agentic Stack

* **Agentic Frameworks:** Google ADK, CrewAI, Hierarchical Orchestration, A2A Communication, MCP.
* **Reasoning & RAG:** Weaviate, Structured Output (Pydantic), Tool-Use (Function Calling), Langfuse, Long-Context Memory Management.
* **Data & Backend:** Python (`FastAPI`, `asyncio`, `pandas`, numpy), Supabase (PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB), Render, Docker, REST/WebSocket API Integration.
* **Observability:** Agent Evaluation, Technical Documentation, Systems Thinking.
