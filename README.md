  <h1> Hi there, I'm Eli! 👋 </h1>

A passionate engineer with a strong focus on designing and building robust, scalable, and maintainable **data pipelines**.

### 🚀 About Me

As a highly analytical and problem-solving engineer, I am passionate about turning raw data into valuable, actionable insights. My core drive is to transform complex data challenges into elegant, efficient, and future-proof architectural designs that streamline data flow and deliver tangible value. I am particularly enthusiastic about:

  * **Data Engineering & ETL Pipelines**
  * **Backend Development & API Integration**
  * **Asynchronous Programming**
  * **Python & Cloud Technologies**
  * **Systems Design & Scalable Architecture**

I believe in the power of well-architected data systems to solve real-world problems and am constantly exploring new ways to design and build efficient and resilient software.

### 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On

I'm currently immersed in **a Media Intelligence Data Ingestion Pipeline**, a project dedicated to building a flexible and powerful backend for media data. My recent focus has been on the **Data Ingestion Layer**, where I've implemented a system that:

  * **Ingests data from APIs:** Collects and processes data from external sources using a modular, extensible approach.
  * **Uses Asynchronous Programming:** Leverages `asyncio` for highly efficient and concurrent data retrieval.
  * **Ensures Data Integrity:** Employs an idempotent loading strategy to prevent data duplication.
  * **Persists to the Cloud:** Stores clean, structured data in a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database.
