# Hi there, I'm Eli! 👋

### Agent Architect | Software Engineer | Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) Specialist

I transform manual strategies into autonomous multi-agent systems. With a background in **Software Engineering** and **Professional Forex Trading**, I bridge the gap between high-stakes financial intuition and autonomous machine reasoning.

### 🚀 The Mission: From Data Pipelines to Agentic Alpha

I don’t just build "AI wrappers." I architect **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems** that reason, plan, and execute. My core focus is solving the **fragility** of traditional algorithmic systems by applying modular task decomposition and adversarial risk-checking.

**My Architectural Philosophy:**
* **Decoupled Reasoning:** Utilizing the **Nexus-Specialist** pattern to mitigate LLM hallucinations.
* **Grounded Execution:** Ensuring every agentic decision is backed by verifiable real-time data.
* **Adversarial Rigor:** Implementing "Red-Team" agents to stress-test trade theses before capital is deployed.

### 📊 Featured Architecture: The Nexus-Specialist Engine

I specialize in designing systems where specialized agents collaborate under a central orchestrator. Below is the blueprint I use for **Autonomous Trade Reasoning**:

### 🌱 Current Focus: The "Virtual Trading Desk"

I am currently building a **Local Trade Reasoning Engine** that serves as a flagship proof-of-concept for my financial agentic frameworks.

* **Orchestration:** Engineering complex delegation loops with **CrewAI**.
* **Adversarial Logic:** Developing a "Risk Simulation Agent" to veto setups based on market regime shifts.
* **Observability:** Implementing deep-trace logging to audit agentic "thought processes" in real-time.

### 🏆 Portfolio Highlight: Kognia AI
**Kognia AI** is a hierarchical MAS framework for autonomous data synthesis and strategic evaluation. It serves as the core proof-of-concept for my Nexus-Specialist architecture.

### 🛠️ The Agentic Stack

* **Agentic Frameworks:** Google ADK (Agent Development Kit), CrewAI, Hierarchical Orchestration, A2A Communication Protocols.
* **Reasoning & Logic:** Structured Output (Pydantic), Tool-Use (Function Calling), RAG Architecture, Long-Context Memory Management.
* **Data & Backend:** Python (`FastAPI`, `asyncio`, `pandas`, `numpy`), SQL (PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB), REST/WebSocket API Integration.
* **Observability:** Agent Evaluation, Technical Documentation, Systems Thinking.

### ⚡ Contact & Collaboration

I am open to collaborating on **Agentic Finance (Fin-Agent)** projects or building bespoke autonomous workflows for prop firms and private funds.
